    <p>Hi I’m Brandon, 18 years old who’s turning 19 in a month as im 
        typing this. I live in Nieuwkoop, a small city which is 15 minutes
        drive from Alphen Aan d/n Rijn. I have multiple hobbies which 
        consists of sport, music and gaming. For sports, I like to play 
        and watch football, and for music i pretty much have a wide 
        range of genre that I can listen too and lastly, I usually play fps
        games on my pc. I’ve come to like programming since my friend
        back in highschool introduced it to me and so far i’ve learn only 
        C# and a little bit of JS. In the coming future I would like to learn
        Python as it is the main language that will be use in my dream 
        job and also the back end parts too.</p>
